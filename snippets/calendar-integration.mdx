## How it works

KnowKR's AI will scan all the meetings you're a part of and do the following:

1. Create a corresponding task in KnowKR based on the meeting title
2. Assign it to tbe appropriate KR by analyzing the meetings title and description. If the meeting title or description contains a KR tag, KnowKR will automatically assign the task to that KR, otherwise it will do its best to assign it to the appropriate KR based on the context.

## Completing Meeting Tasks

When a meeting is completed in {title}, KnowKR will automatically mark the corresponding task as completed. This way, you can easily see your progress towards KRs without manually needing to update them.

## How to Update Meeting Tasks

When you update a meeting (ie. Change the title, description, etc), KnowKR will automatically update the corresponding task in KnowKR.
Tasks update periodically throughout the day so if you make a change in {title}, it may take some time to reflect in KnowKR.
