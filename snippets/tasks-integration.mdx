## How it works

KnowKR's AI will scan all the issues assigned to you in {title} and do the following:

1. Create a corresponding task in KnowKR based on the issue title
2. Assign it to tbe appropriate KR by analyzing the issue title and description. If the issue title or description contains a KR tag, KnowKR will automatically assign the task to that KR otherwise it will do its best to assign it to the appropriate KR based on the context.

## How to Update Tasks

When you update an issue in {title}, KnowKR will automatically update the corresponding task in KnowKR. This way, you can easily see your progress towards KRs without manually needing to update them.
Tasks update periodically throughout the day so if you make a change in {title}, it may take some time to reflect in KnowKR.
