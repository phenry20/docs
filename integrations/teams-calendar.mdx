The MS Teams Calendar integration allows you to automatically create and update tasks in KnowKR from MS Teams meetings.

    </Step>
    <Step title="That's It">

    </Step>
</Steps>

## How it works

KnowKR's AI will scan all the meetings you're a part of and do the following:

1. Create a corresponding task in KnowKR based on the meeting title
2. Assign it to tbe appropriate KR by analyzing the meetings title and description. If the meeting title or description contains a KR tag, KnowKR will automatically assign the task to that KR, otherwise it will do its best to assign it to the appropriate KR based on the context.

## Completing Meeting Tasks

When a meeting is completed in MS Teams, KnowKR will automatically mark the corresponding task as completed. This way, you can easily see your progress towards KRs without manually needing to update them.

## How to Update Meeting Tasks

When you update a meeting (ie. Change the title, description, etc), KnowKR will automatically update the corresponding task in KnowKR.
Tasks update periodically throughout the day so if you make a change in MS Teams, it may take some time to reflect in KnowKR.
