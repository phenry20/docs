## Overview

KnowKR provides a powerful API that allows you to automate updates to your OKRs. Although there isn't a direct integration between KnowKR and Zapier, you can still utilize Zapier's "Code by Zapier" action to update your OKRs within Zapier.

## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
    <Step title="Obtain Your KnowKR API Key">
        <GetApiKey />
    </Step>

    <Step title="Identify the Measurement Value in Your Zap">
        1. Set up your Zap (in Zapier) to capture the necessary measurement value from an app or service in your workflow.
        2. Ensure the value is a number and is available as a data variable for use in subsequent steps.
    </Step>

    <Step title='Add a "Code by Zapier" Action'>
        1. In your Zap, add an action step and search for "Code by Zapier."
        2. Select the Run JavaScript option.
        3. Configure the following settings:
            - Input Data:
                - id: The key result id (you can get this from selecting a key result on the KnowKR dashboard)
                - value: The measurement value you captured in the previous step.
                - token: Your KnowKR API key obtained in the first step.

            - Code: Use the provided code snippet to update the measurement value for your key result.
                    ```javascript
                    await fetch('https://app.knowkr.com/api/key-results/measurements', {
                        method: "POST",
                        headers: {
                            "X-API-TOKEN": inputData.token
                        },
                        data: {
                            // The id of your key result
                            id: inputData.id,

                            // The new measurement value
                            value: Number(inputData.value)
                        }
                    })
                    ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Test Your Zap">
        1. Save and test your Zap.
        2. Ensure the data flows correctly and updates the intended OKR measurement in KnowKR.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Activate Your Zap">
        Once the test is successful, turn on your Zap to automate OKR measurement updates.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Additional Considerations

**Rate Limits**: Ensure your API usage stays within KnowKR's rate limits (5 requests per minute).
**Security**: Never expose your API key in publicly shared workflows.
