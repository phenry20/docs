## Overview

KnowKR provides a powerful API that allows you to automate updates to your OKRs. Although there isn't a direct integration between KnowKR and Make, you can still utilize Make's HTTP Module to update your OKRs within Make.

## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
    <Step title="Obtain Your KnowKR API Key">
        <GetApiKey />
    </Step>

    <Step title="Identify the Measurement Value in Your Scenario">
        1. Set up your Scenario (in Make) to capture the necessary measurement value from an app or service in your workflow.
        2. Ensure the value is a number and is available as a data variable for use in subsequent steps.
    </Step>

    <Step title='Add the Http Module'>
        1. In your Scenario, add a module and search for "Make an API Key Auth Request."
        2. Click on "Create a keychain" to add your credentials:
            - Name: KnowKR API Key
            - Key: Your KnowKR API key obtained in the first step.
            - Api Key Placement: Header
            - Header Name: X-API-TOKEN
        3. Configure the following settings:
            - URL: https://app.knowkr.com/api/key-results/measurements
            - Method: POST
            - Body Type: Raw
            - Content type: Json (application/json)

            - Body:
                Replace `your-key-result-id` with the id of your key result (you can get this from selecting a key result on the KnowKR dashboard)
                and `your-measurement-value` with the measurement value you captured in the previous step (you can use a Make variable).
                ```json
                {
                    "id": "your-key-result-id",
                    "value": "your-measurement-value"
                }
                ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Test Your Scenario">
        1. Save and test your Scenario.
        2. Ensure the data flows correctly and updates the intended OKR measurement in KnowKR.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Activate Your Scenario">
        Once the test is successful, turn on your Scenario to automate OKR measurement updates.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Additional Considerations

**Rate Limits**: Ensure your API usage stays within KnowKR's rate limits (5 requests per minute).
**Security**: Never expose your API key in publicly shared workflows.
