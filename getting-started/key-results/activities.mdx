Activities in KnowKR are the inputs that contribute to the completion of your Key Results. You can think of activities as __things you do__ (ie. Meetings, Creating Docs, Doing Tasks, etc.) to achieve your Key Results.

## How to track activities

Activities are automatically tracked in KnowKR using tags and AI through integrations. By navigating to the [Integrations](https://app.knowkr.com/integrations) page you can connect to the tools you use at work, KnowKR will then begin tracking your activities one of two ways:

#### Tags

This is the recommended and most accurate way to track your activities. When Key Results are created you will be required to create 1 or more unique tags to associate with the Key Result.

You can then tag your activities with the Key Result Tag. For example: If you have a meeting you want to track, just add it to the title or description of the meeting OR if you have a task you want to track, just add the tag to the title or description of the task.

KnowKR will then sync the activity and automatically keep track of it for you, updates and all.

<Info>Tags are case-insensitive and can be added anywhere in the title or description of the activity.</Info>

<Tip>Download the [KnowKR Chrome Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/knowkr/labhommmfookapieoodebdeohhkamllm?hl=en) in order to access your tags anywhere on the web</Tip>


#### AI

This is the fallback method for tracking activities. If you forget to tag your activities, KnowKR will use AI to determine if the activity is related to a Key Result and update your progress accordingly.
If you find that KnowKR is not tracking your activities correctly, you can always go back and tag them manually or adjust them on the KnowKR dashboard.

**Note**: KnowKR's AI isn't perfect, but it tries to be as accurate as possible. If the AI doesn't have enough information to determine if an activity is related to a Key Result, it will mark the activity as "In Review" so you can manually adjust it on the app.
