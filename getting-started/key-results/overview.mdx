## What are Smart Key Results (SKRs) in KnowKR?

Smart Key Results are Key Results that manage themselves.
They automatically track your activities and progress toward achieving your goals, eliminating the need for manual updates or data tracking. With SKRs,
you can focus entirely on your work while ensuring your progress is always up-to-date and accurately reflected.

### How tracking works

KnowKR uses tags and AI to automatically track your goal progression. When you create a Key Result in KnowKR, it will automatically track your [activities](/getting-started/key-results/activities) and [progression (workflows)](/getting-started/key-results/workflows) via AI and tags.
