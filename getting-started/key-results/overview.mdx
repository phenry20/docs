## What are Smart Key Results (SKRs) in KnowKR?

so you can focus on your work and not on updating your progress and tracking data.

### How tracking works

KnowKR uses tags and AI to automatically track your goal progression. When you create a Key Result in KnowKR, it will automatically track your [activities](/getting-started/key-results/activities) and [progression (workflows)](/getting-started/key-results/workflows) via AI and tags.
